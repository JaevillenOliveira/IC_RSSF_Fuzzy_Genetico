	-Second time running the third scenario	
	-12 Aps instead of 15
	-Trying to increase throughput (unsuccessfull)
	-throughput stays in the same range
	-packet loss decreases comparing with the 15APs version (probably because a better distribution 
		sensor/APs is made)
	-power consumption increases (?)
